I cloned the GitHub repository [https://github.com/httpie/cli.git](https://github.com/httpie/cli.git) and opened it in Visual Studio Code. After installing the GitLens extension, I explored the codebase and navigated to the `httpie/client.py` file. From this file, I selected the `collect_messages` function for analysis. Using GitLens, I hovered over the function definition to find out who originally wrote it, then used the "Show File History" option to determine when it was last updated, and finally viewed the line history to identify the specific commit that first introduced the function. I captured three screenshots from these stepsâ€”one showing the author and commit details (blame), one showing the most recent change (last commit), and one showing the commit where the function was first added. Lastly, I created a markdown file named `gitlens_insights.md` where I documented all these findings along with the screenshots.
